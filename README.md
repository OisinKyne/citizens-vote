Casting Dáil Votes to the Ethereum Blockchain

## What is it?

This is a lightweight dApp that makes use of the [Oireachtas Open Data API](https://api.oireachtas.ie/) to allow regular people that might be considering a run for elected office at some point in their future to build up a Voting Record.

Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The long and short of it is that Blockchain technology gives internet users a way to store permanent, unmodifiable data to the public internet, that Facebook nor Google, nor any individual or State can change or censor on your behalf. The technology is in it's infancy but it is revolutionising how the public holds their Government's and elected officials accountable to the rule of Law.

## What is it good for?

I see this app as good for people who are into Irish Politics, people who are looking to learn more about what Irish Politicians do, or would consider a run for public office at some point in their lives. Running for office as a first time candidate is difficult as you have to convince your potential constituents that you are who you say you are, and that you'll vote how you say you vote. What better a way is there for you to put your money where your mouth is other than casting your vote on Dáil Bills permanently in plain text to the Ethereum Blockchain?

If you vote dilligently on Dáil bills before you run for office, you will be able to prove to your voters that you're not just promising them nice things during election time, you can go back in history and prove your track record on an issue as confidently as if you had published your vote to the classifieds of the New York Times. Sure, most people haven't heard of Blockchain yet, and might not get why casting your vote to a blockchain means you couldn't have changed it since it was cast. Most people didn't understand what all the fuss was about about the internet in the 90's though either. Does most of the world know what the internet is now, 20+ years later? They sure do.

## What does this change?

Blockchain technology has allowed us to close the trust gap between elected officials and first time candidates, by giving first time candidates a way to build a track record out of office. I hope this will improve the standard of political debate in this country, especially during election time.

## How do I use this app?

To use this app, you need to use either Chrome or Firefox on a desktop. You need to install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as a browser extension. Once you have MetaMask installed, you should create an Ethereum address to use. This address will be what identifies your votes to anyone you want to prove them to. Finally, to cast votes you need to fund your address with some ether to pay transaction fees. At this point in time, transaction fees are about €0.20 per vote, but that varies depending on the time of day and traffic on the network.
